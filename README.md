#### Open Image Datasets

This simple header only C library can read popular classification datasets.

## 1.	Classification datasets

We are using `IMDSImage` type for each datasets. It has width,height,the number of images,images and labels only.

### MNIST(mnist.h)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9BcVOYQ.png" width="256">

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

This script automatically download MNIST datasets to your temporary directory at once. So you just need below 2 functions.

The default parameters are only available in C++. It automatically disable in C.
```cpp
IMDSImage GetMnistTrainData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true);
```

```cpp
IMDSImage GetMnistValidData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true);`
```

*	Parameters

	*	padding : The top,bottom,left and right padding of image.
	*	alpha : Multiply this value to each pixel.
	*	bias : Adding bias input on image if this value set true.

###### Example

```cpp
IMDSImage train= GetMnistTrainData(0, 1 / 255.0F,true);
IMDSImage valid= GetMnistValidData(0, 1 / 255.0F,true);
```
### Fashion(mnist.h)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MtTIit7.png" width="256">

**[Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)** is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

```cpp
IMDSImage GetFashionTrainData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

```cpp
IMDSImage GetFashionValidData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

### Cifar-10(cifar10.h)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X7Tv9dQ.png" width="256">

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

```cpp
IMDSImage GetCifar10TrainData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

```cpp
IMDSImage GetCifar10ValidData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

```cpp
char* GetCifar10Class(int index)
```

### STL-10(stl10.h)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G5yL6qw.jpg" width="256">

The STL-10 dataset is an image recognition dataset for developing unsupervised feature learning, deep learning, self-taught learning algorithms. It is inspired by the CIFAR-10 dataset but with some modifications. In particular, each class has fewer labeled training examples than in CIFAR-10, but a very large set of unlabeled examples is provided to learn image models prior to supervised training. The primary challenge is to make use of the unlabeled data (which comes from a similar but different distribution from the labeled data) to build a useful prior. We also expect that the higher resolution of this dataset (96x96) will make it a challenging benchmark for developing more scalable unsupervised learning methods.

```cpp
IMDSImage GetSTL10TrainData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

```cpp
IMDSImage GetSTL10ValidData(int padding=0,float alpha=1.0F,bool bias=true)
```

```cpp
char* GetSTL10Class(int index)
```
